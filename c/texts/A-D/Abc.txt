14.5 THE IMPLEMENTATION LANDSCAPE

Now that you know about EC and social media benefits and applications, you may wonder what to do next. First you need
to ask questions such as: “Do I need EC and social media?” and then “How am I going to do it?” The answers to these two
and other questions can be very complex since they depend on many factors that we will discuss in this chapter. We refer to
these factors as implementation factors.

The Major Implementation Factors
Many factors can determine the need and success of EC and social media projects. We organize them in the following categories.

Justification/Economics

The first issue is to find out if you need to get involved in an EC or social media project(s). This issue can be very complex
for large-scale projects. We call this EC and social media project justification.

Acquire or Self-Develop Your E-Commerce or Social Media Management System

This issue is not simple either, especially when medium- and large-scale projects are involved. In the case of social media, a
system for managing campaigns may not be needed but could be helpful depending on the volume of interaction and the
available staff time.

Organizational Readiness and Impacts of E-Commerce

How to organize your EC and social media projects within the organization and how to deal with changing business pro-
cesses and other changes brought by EC and social media are all part of the implementation considerations. In addition,
potential impacts on marketing, manufacturing, and people need to be addressed. Finally, technical issues such as connecting
to other information systems need to be considered.

How to Succeed

The last part of this chapter addresses some of the critical success factors of implementing EC projects.
